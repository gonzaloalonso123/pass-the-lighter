    "q": "What is pass the lightr?",
    "a": "Pass the Lightr is a project created by Daan Kuiper and Gonzalo Alonso. The both of us have always found it fascinating how you lose lighters and how you find a new one in your pocket after a night out for instance. This gave us the idea of tracking them and seeing how many kilometres a lighter might travel and what it comes along on its journey!"
  },
  {
    "q": "How does it work?",
    "a": "When you find or receive a lighter, you enter the code found on the lighter on the main page. If you are the first person to log this lighter, you will be able to give it a nickname and a profile picture. After, you will be asked if you received it or you found it, where and when, and lastly youâ€™ve got the option to leave a story behind your passing on experience, including a picture! A map will show up as well, showing where the lighter has travelled and the total distance it has travelled. Also you will be able to see how many people have logged this lighter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I also get some lighters to start spreading stories?",
    "a": "Currently, you can only find them in the field. Soon we would like to offer an option to donate and get some lighter stickers in return for your support. This will give you the opportunity to spread a few of your own lighters, into the world!"
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to log in or something?",
    "a": "No. Everything is handled by nicknames and no personal data is asked nor stored."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I find you in social media?",
    "a": "Yes, on Instagram only for now. @passthelightr is where you can find us!"
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I contact you guys?",
    "a": "Shoot and email! daan@passthelightr.com"
